## Who are you guys?
Good question, who are we. We are an independent web design and development agency based in Amsterdam. We have designed and built websites and applications used by millions of people. Bakker Labs was started and is owned by Jaap Bakker. 

## The tools we use
This website used to be a custom build node.js application with a blog powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org). We soon found this solution way to complicated and moved to a different setup. Right now the whole website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). For the layout we're using a slightly modified [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/) just because flexbox is awesome and it's made developing web applications so much easier.

## What's that font?
You like it? Me too ðŸ‘Œ! It's called Bree and you can get it on [fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com/font/typetogether/bree)!
