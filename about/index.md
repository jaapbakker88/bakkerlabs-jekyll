## Who are you guys?
Hello

## The tools we use

This website used to be a custom build node.js application with a blog powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org). We soon found this solution way to complicated and moved to a different setup. Right now the whole website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). For the layout we're using a slightly modified [Flexbox Grid](http://flexboxgrid.com/) just because flexbox is awesome and it's made developing web applications so much easier.
