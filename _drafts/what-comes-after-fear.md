One of the insights I took back from New York is about dealing with fear. We all know it and we all suffer from it from time to time. I have suffered from it and still suffer from it from time to time. So how do you deal with fear? How do you channel it? Well, it might be good to look at what fear actually is before we get started solving the problem we're having with fear. 

## Stuff you should know about fear [^1]

> "Fear is a chain reaction in the brain that starts with a stressful stimulus and ends with the release of chemicals that cause a racing heart, fast breathing and energized muscles, among other things, also known as the fight-or-flight response. The stimulus could be a spider, a knife at your throat, an auditorium full of people waiting for you to speak or the sudden thud of your front door against the door frame."



## The thing is:

> What's comes after fear? Nothing...

Most of our fears are irrational. We have the fealing of fear, but there are no concequences to the thing we're afraid of. Or no real consequenses. Some people might be afraid to start practicing the're newly learned language, some people are afraid of calling strangers or when networking, you might be afraid to approach someone. Heck, it even applies to approaching a cute guy or girl in a bar. Take the following rule I have for myself:

> Will asking or talking to X kill anyone or have any other serious consequences? No, then do it.
