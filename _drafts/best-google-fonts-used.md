Over the course of my first freelancing year I have been using a ton of fonts for a bunch of different clients. And even though I have a subscription at fonts.com I still use Google Fonts most of the time. And that's just because it's so good. It's super easy to implement and they have a very big selection of very good fonts. True, there's a couple that are really good and you can see used on a variety of webpages. If you know where to look. So, this is a short list of Google Fonts that I really like to use and can make your website look so much better.
