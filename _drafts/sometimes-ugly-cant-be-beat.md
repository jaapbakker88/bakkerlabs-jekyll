[Craigslist](https://amsterdam.craigslist.org/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and of course dutch party directory [Partyflock](https://partyflock.nl/) are all example of websites I either love to use, or need to use. In both cases because there simply isn't anything better on the market. But the're ugly. And even though there's beauty to be found in all those designs, they will always be ugly.   

Sometimes I think as a designer: this should be fixed. There is a use opportunity for creating just that party website, but beautiful. But do we actually need this?

We have seen a couple of Dutch websites go beautiful after being acquired by some big company a - hello Marktplaats. They have been steadily upgrading their UI. This made me think: when your so successful, you can't just start changing your UI just because it looks better, people are used to that old and ugly outdated UI.
