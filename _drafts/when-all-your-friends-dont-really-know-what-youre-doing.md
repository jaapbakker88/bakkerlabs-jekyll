When you're getting older you definitely going to lose contact with some people, and that's not a bad thing. You will run in to them every once in a while and you'll catch up. A question you're going to hear quite often is: what do you do these days? Or at least, that's a question I hear almost every day. The thing is, even a lot of my best friends don't really know what I'm doing. It's even worse, sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing. 

My email signature says the following: 

> Everything web, design, development and consultancy 

And that kind of covers it I think. My main focus is webdesign. But I do UI and UX as well, I do backend development from time to time, front-end development as well. And next to that I do, SEO, CRO and ASO and social media.
