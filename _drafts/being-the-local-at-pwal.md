The first job I landed as a freelancer was working for a small Amsterdam based startup called Party with a Local. As you may have guessed already. We help locals connect with travelers to enjoy a night out. Like a local. In this company I am actually the only local, and this is not alway easy.

I really like working for Party with a Local because at the company I get the chance to develop myself and work on a real product that I really believe in. I started out as the front-end developer at the company, but now I am also responsible for the design and I'm starting to get into the back-end as well. Really rewarding as a starter in the tech scene.

The second reason is definitely the team. I have never worked in a team that works so hard and at the same time is always having a good time! 
Same goes for the community. All of Party with a Local's members really believe in the concept and do everything to help us make this thing a success!

It's very confronting to be the only dutch person in a company. You get confronted with all the cultural differences everyday. Altough, a couple days back they admitted I might be the least Dutch person in the company and I am inclined to take this as a compliment.
