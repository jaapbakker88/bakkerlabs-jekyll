As my personal site is always somewhat of an online laboratory for new experiments I decided to drop Google Analytics and started using [Heap Analytics](https://heapanalytics.com/r/024hh) [^1]. I came across this analytics platform while I was out searching for a tool to manage A/B testing on a static website for one of my clients. I don’t really know if it’s capable of doing so yet.

But, after the super easy installation I dropped into the onboarding where you create a couple of events, segments, funnels and reports, I knew this was a very powerful tool. Maybe way to powerful for what I’m looking for, but, as I said, this website is more of an online laboratory than a lead magnet. And if it ever becomes one, even better. So, whatever. 😎
