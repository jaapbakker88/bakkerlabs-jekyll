Working for free on something that feels important to you or maybe even your career. **Should you do this and how to stay motivated for something that doesn't make you money?** I have a project like this, it's called: The Pilot Crowd.

#### So what is The Pilot Crowd?
When you want to become a traffic pilot you need to bring in a lot of money. Until recently future pilots in The Netherlands could get loans of up to €200.000 to finance their studies. Then 2008 happened and along with other sectors, the flying business kind of collapsed. The pilots still had their HUGE debts, but there were no jobs for them to pay these start paying of these debts. This is obviously a problem.

My friend and founder of The Pilot Crowd was one of those pilots. He decided to take charge and do a crowdfunding for his student loan. He sold the loan in about 15 bits of €10.000 euro each and lowered his interest rate of the full loan by 3%. The investors on the other hand got a 4% interest over their investment in return. A win-win situation. This struck a chord with my friend and he decided to start a business, helping other pilots set up the same crowdfunding for their loans. 

Then the following happened: ABN AMRO, the only bank in The Netherlands offering these special kind of pilot-loans decided to step out of this business after controversies around these loans. So now there seems to be no likely option to become a pilot in The Netherlands anymore. This is the second entry point at The Pilot Crowd. 

#### And your role?
My role in this business is of course a technical role. But I am also there for a more startup kind of looking at things. My experience and connections in the Dutch startup community is the second reason.

I'm fulfilling this role in my spare time though, I still need to make money to pay the rent and the costs of running a freelance business. My friend knows this, and he has a job as a pilot next to doing this as well. So we will not be able to move as fast as we might want to, but that's okay. 
I do think it is a good thing to have a project like this you can always work on. Especially as a freelancer you do not always have the projects to fill up your time. And instead of doing nothing, playing games or watching television you now **always** have a project to work on. 

There's one more tricky part in this story. In the text you have just read I mentioned my friend a couple of times. But we're businesspartners now as well. I am not sure in what way this is going to change our relationship, but people keep telling me not to start working for friends and family. It complicates things. I do not know about this and we will probably see what's going to happen. 

#### Anyway...
We just launched in The Netherlands. We launched our website and published a press release. Now the real challenges will begin. If you have ideas, feedback, or want to join, please [let me know](mailto:hello@bakkerlabs.nl).
