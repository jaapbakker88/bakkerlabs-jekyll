One of the most requested services at Bakker Labs is SEO. Year after year it's getting more important. Year after year it's getting more difficult as well. Recently we took a deep dive into working with [Mangools SEO Tools](https://mangools.com). At the time of writing they have two incredible services, [Keyword Finder](https://kwfinder.com#a595e8cbd285f73104de65021) and [SERP Checker](https://serpchecker.com#a595e8cbd285f73104de65021), you can use for a very reasonable price, and the third service, [SERP Watcher](https://serpwatcher.com#a595e8cbd285f73104de65021), is coming this month. I can't wait for that one. But first things first:

### What is SEO?
*Search engine optimization is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid resultsâ€”often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned".* [^1]

So in natural language that means everything you do in order to get as high up in the results as possible. There's multiple ways to do this, which I won't get into today, because the ways of doing this are always changing. 

Today, we'll talk about the Search Engine Results Page(SERP) and keywords. Keywords are by far the most important thing in SEO. Back in the old days you could basically just spam your website with keywords and you got ranked for them. Nowadays it's a finer balance. You'll need a delicate balance in the weight of keywords(keyword density on the page). To figure all this stuff out you're going to need some decent tools. So you won't have to do all the calculating, but only have to worry about the actual content. 

Right now, Mangools has two SEO tools available. First off is the [Keyword Finder](https://kwfinder.com#a595e8cbd285f73104de65021). This tool is just about discovering new keywords to rank for. You give it a keyword, it gives you infinite variations for you to choose from in return. Sometimes it's really hard to think of keywords right off the top off you head at this tool is your perfect companion in you keyword research.

### Why keyword research is so important?

Well, you don't need everyone on the internet to find your website. You just need to find the specific edge cases visiting your website. You don't need a million clients, you need a couple. They're more valuable because they know what they want and are therefor more ready to buy when they visit your website. The thing is, you can't think of these keywords yourself, and if you can you won't be able to tell if there's any trafic to a keyword like that at all. That's why you need to determine which keywords are right, which are going to drive trafic.

The other one is the [SERP Checker](https://serpchecker.com#a595e8cbd285f73104de65021) and let's you check out the competition on the keywords you've decided on and determine your SEO strategy that way. The SERP Checker basically shows the Search Engine Results Page(SERP) for a specific keyword (see the screenshot below). Of all these results it shows very detailed information about these results. As you can see 'Keyword Density' is not a keyword you're quickly going to rank for. There's lot of [high authority domains](https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority) already ranking for this keyword. The interface of the SERPChecker is super easy but really versatile as well. If you just need to do a quick research for a specific keyword, you'll just look at the rank all the way in the left column. If it's a high number, maybe try finding a better keyword to rank for, because this one's really difficult.

The third tool by Mangools is yet to be released, but it's set to happen this month. This tool is called the [SERP Watcher](https://serpwatcher.com#a595e8cbd285f73104de65021) and I'm really excited for it. This tool basically let's you track keywords you're trying to rank for and how you're doing in those rankings. This gives you the ability to check for anomalies and update accordingly. I have yet to try it out but really can't wait to get my hands on it and start using it on my own projects an my clients projects. 

### To sum it up

Mangools gives you an awesome set of tools to start optimizing your website for Google and other search engines. It gives you the power to quickly discover keywords and how people rank for them and to see if it's an opportunity or a challenge.
