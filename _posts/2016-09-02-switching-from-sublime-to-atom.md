When speaking to developers the following question is inevitable: 

> Atom or Sublime?

I had been working with Sublime Text 2 for a long time when I decided to try Atom for a couple of weeks to see if I liked it. I have not gone back. 

In the end they're mostly the same. Some of the shortcuts are  a little different, the looks of Atom are a little more modern but all of this comes down to your own personal preferences. Sublime feels more hackable but this also makes it a lot harder to understand. Atom can do most of the same stuff but installing plugins is a lot easier.  

The only downside is that Atom feels a little heavier than Sublime. This makes opening big folders sometimes last a little longer than I would have liked. But it doesn't take the awesome experience of using Atom away.
