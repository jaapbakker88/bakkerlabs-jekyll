I'm back from New York, but in my time there I collected a lot of little snippets of text I still need or want to publish. This is a little list I collected over the first few weeks of my time in New York. This specific list consists of American Slang I have either heard or heard of. It's all definitely been said though. 

- You got it
- Booyah
- What's poppin'
- Gotcha!
- Dawg, homie!
- It's def mos lit
- Let's bounce
- take a walk 
- Oh, that‚Äôs interesting
- All y'all
- Take a hike
- How‚Äôs it hanging?
- ...

And then I stopped recording all the silly stuff people say in America. It was either too much or I just got used to it. 

> ### "Oh, that's interesting"

This one really annoyed me. When your talking to someone, especially someone you just met they kind of keep the conversation going by saying this over and over. Most of the times it doesn't really feel like the're actually saying anything or listening to you though. 

But most of the times it's just a lot of fun. Because Americans speak really loud, you get to hear most of what they say! üëç

*PS. I left one out because it was a little bit too explicit and I did not want my blog to be crawled with that kind of content on it.*
