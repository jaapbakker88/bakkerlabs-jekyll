Working with Sketch is a pleasure. As you can read in one of my earlier posts I recently started doing all my design work in Sketch and have since not used Photoshop or Illustrator except when I needed some details on an old design. One of the great things about Sketch is that there are already a ton of plugins that make your life so much easier. That's why I decided to write a list of the plugins I am currently using. 

### Sketch Notebook Pro
This little plugin helps you a great lot when you need to share your design with a developer to get all the font sizes and dimensions right. You can easily add a notebook to your artboard and start adding your annotations with a couple of simple shortcuts.

### Craft by InVision LABS
Craft makes working with Sketch and InVision much better. The ability to sync your designs directly to the InVision prototype saves me a ton of work and makes managing the multiple screens so much easier. There's also auto duplication based a grid, document and universal text and design styles and a [Pexels](pexels.com) integration for automatic downloading files. Can't live without this one anymore!

### Lorem Ipsum Dolor
Need dummy text? This simple plugins get the popular [Lipsum](lipsum.com) and feeds it into your text area. You'll never have to leave sketch again.
