So, email does not seem to be going away anytime soon and the internet is getting really crowded. I have had multiple blog's and never seemed to get a foot on the ground. I agree, this was mainly because I did not try hard enough. The other reason was that I was afraid of what people would think. But, the last few years my life has been coming together and I have found what I want to do in my life. 

Publishing content is still something I want to do. And I'm done worrying about what people think. Every time I hit that `publish` button I'm overcoming the fear but also becoming stronger. And it feels great. 

So coming back to email, it has been around for a long time, hasn't changed much and it's a very direct way in to peoples life. So, one of my goals this year as a part of my freelance business life was to start building out a personal email list to keep up to date and generate work leads from. And aside from that, just generally inform what I am up to and push the content that I occasionally write on this blog. This is me accomplishing that goal, and pushing people [to subscribe](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/jaapbakker).

So, go ahead and [sign up](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/jaapbakker), while waiting for the first issue to be released.

PS. I know I should have started this thing before I went to New York. Well, too late now.
