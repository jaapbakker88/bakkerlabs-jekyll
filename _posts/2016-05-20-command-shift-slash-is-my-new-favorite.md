Sometimes you're introduced to a new keyboard shortcut that really makes your life easier. I was actually actively seeking for this shortcut because I was working in an app that constantly required me to dig into menu's to get to certain options. So at some point instead of clicking through menu's, I clicked the help button and searched from there. Every Mac app has this option and this was actually the first time I actually used it and it worked pretty well. But I still needed to click help and this disturbed my flow very much. So I searched for the shortcut to get there using my keyboard and there is was. **Command + shift + forward slash**. Or, command + ?.
