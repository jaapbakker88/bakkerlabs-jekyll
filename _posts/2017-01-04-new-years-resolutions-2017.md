Hey there everyone. You might know me as someone who never has any new years resolutions. But this morning I was listening to a  [couple of podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/podcast/design-life/id1063264363?mt=2) like I do almost every morning, but today, as it's January 3rd, a lot of them talked about resolutions and their goals for 2017. This kind of inspired me to set some goals for 2017 as well. So, here we go:

### Build up a portfolio by self briefing projects
I need some kind of portfolio going into the new year. I have been working on a lot of stuff but nothing which I have been able to call my own. And that's just the thing I need: Something to call my own. So that's the first goal on the list. I already thought of a couple projects I want to work on as soon as I get back from the United States. A very much **business oriented** goal.
 
### Write one article every week on jaap.ninja
I have set up this blog about a year ago. And before that I have had many blogs. The only thing is I never had breath enough to make it really work. This is something I really want to do: publish an article every week. It can be about the stuff I am learning, about freelancing, about design or even traveling. As long as I publish at least something every week. This one is **for all my readers**.

### Set up a agency like business for at least one project
Another one in the **business category**. I haven been working for my self the last year and while it was really great. Sometimes it was really lonely and I felt I didn't have anyone to really share my experiences with. So the last couple of weeks I started thinking. I want some big new client with a challenging brief. For that I'll probably need some more people to work with. So I might set up a project with a couple of freelancers. Like a sort of pop-up agency. I might be the projectmanager or designer and we would get a developer and start a joint project. I might need to work this out a little but this sounds like something cool and might be the next step in my **business**.  

### Get The Pilot Crowd live
This is more something about finishing what you started. About a year ago I joint a friend of mine in his business venture. We started [The Pilot Crowd](https://pilotcrowd.nl). The Pilot Crowd helps pilots refinance their student loans through private crowdfunding. I started this project but because of me and my friends busy schedules we haven't been able to get it off the ground. As soon as I'm back from New York I will set this in motion. I can't wait to get my hands on this one. 

### Study at least once a day on JavaScript
Last year was me discovering a new career path and venturing into the unknown. A lot of that was learning and orienting myself in the world of JavaScript. I learned a lot and go to know a lot of stuff, but this year, I want to take it to the next level and and start working one day a week on my JavaScript. This will mean I'll dedicate a day a week to reading, practicing and developing with JavaScript.

### Get a better morning routine
I'm not terrible at this. But I can be more consistent. Usually I wake up pretty early. But every morning is kind of chaotic. This could be because for the last I don't know how many years I have had roommates that can mess up your routine, but it's also me. I want to start doing yoga and meditation to keep my body and mind in shape and eat a healthy breakfast everyday. This one also segues nice into the next and final goal:

### Go running at least once every week
Preferably I do this 3 times a week. But that has been hard to keep up the last couple of years and I fear it might have been overkill on the good intentions. So, at least once a week is the goal for now.

So, that's it for the resolutions. They came very natural to me. This morning during my breakfast I literally came across four different podcasts talking about their goals for the new year and it inspired me. I have been thinking about it the whole day and when I sat down tonight in my bed, the words just started flowing. This is a great sign for the next year: because even though I caught the worst cold I've had in ages, I feel good about the year to come and have a lot of ideas and energy to pursue it.
